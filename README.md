# CSCI2275Final

My project is meant to represent the ordering and production of a product at a store or factory. The orderer and their "tab" is kept track of in a dictionary as they order more products. A priority queue, implemented as a heap, determines what orders are fulfilled first. Part of the program allows the ordering of more products while another part simulates fulfilling these requests in a proper order.
